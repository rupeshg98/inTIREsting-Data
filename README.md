My team and I conducted this project for a data hackathon. This is consisted of a machine learning data model that utilizes vehicle 
registration data and other external data sets to predict demand for certain types of tires. The algorithm we used was random forest
regression. We became the second place winner of Best Data Model Award and first place winner of Unique Thinker Award.
